Agent Py
========
Clippy for Linux.

'Cuz FUCK YOU that's why.

* * *

Agent Py is intended to be a pure Python implementation of Microsoft Agent,
the "technonlogy" behind [the][] [infamous][] [Clippy][].  Initially, I plan
to have basic support for displaying Agent characters (in ACS format only,
not the narrowband-friendly ACF/ACA format), making them talk via word bubbles
(and *maybe* text-to-speech), and for showing arbitrary HTML or Web pages in
so-called WebKit bubbles.  And it will *all* work on Windows, OS X, and Linux
(but Linux first 'cuz that's what I use).
